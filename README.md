 The Zip Code Wealth Trap

This scrollytelling project explores how **place—not just income—shapes wealth outcomes** for Black Americans. By comparing two ZIP codes (29840, SC and 60458, IL) with nearly identical Black median incomes, we uncover how vastly different rates of homeownership—and therefore wealth—can exist in parallel.

 🧭 What This Project Shows

- Two ZIP codes, same income: ~$43,000
- One has a 99% Black homeownership rate; the other, just 4.5%
- The difference? Not income, but **location-based opportunity**: housing access, historical barriers, policy, and place

Through visual storytelling, this project asks:
> What if your ZIP code—not your effort—decided your future?



 📊 Data Source

All data was sourced from the [Black Wealth Data Center (BWDC)](https://blackwealthdata.org).  
Homeownership and income data were retrieved from the BWDC dashboard and datasets.



 🤖 AI Usage

I used **ChatGPT** as a learning companion to:
- Understand Svelte scrollytelling layout techniques
- Debug visibility-triggered animation issues
- Clarify how to use Chart.js in Svelte
- Write some structural `README.md` and deployment guidance

All design decisions, content, and structure were created and customized by me.


 🧰 Tools Used

- **Svelte** (frontend framework)
- **Vite** (build + dev server)
- **Chart.js** (bar chart visualization)
- **IntersectionObserver API** (scroll-triggered animation)
- **GitHub Pages** (deployment)
